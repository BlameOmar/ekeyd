Simtec Electronics Entropy Key -- Host Software ChangeLog
---------------------------------------------------------

This document summarises the changes between public releases of the
Entropy Key host software.

v1.1.4
	* Improve ekey-rekey command line handling so master key can
	  be entered interactively.
	* Improve ekey-rekey command locating suitable USB devices
	  automatically.
	* Improve host tools Makefile to install egd-linux if built
	* Make EGD client cope with read timeouts

v1.1.3
	* Improve handling of failed rekeying. Will now attempt to
	  re-establish a keyed session every 50 recived packets instead of
	  leaving the connection "Long term key bad"
	* Removed some debug to improve CPU consumption.
	* PEM Decode speedup, courtesy of nix@esperi.org.uk
	* EGD Entropy dispatch speedup, courtesy of nix@esperi.org.uk
	* Key badness rework, courtesy of nix@esperi.org.uk
	* EGD-Linux tool resilient in the face of EINTR of poll()

v1.1.2
	* Various improvements in internal buffer management.
	* Improve serial number handling in ekey-rekey.
	* Support hostnames in egd-linux.
	  - This patch provided by Tollef Fog Heen of Collabora.
	* Keyring writing in ekey-setkey is now more careful with
	  its permissions.  Concept courtesy of Kees Cook of Debian
	* Improve serial number handling in munin script.
	  - This patch provided by Wouter Verhelst of Debian
	* Improve the TotalEntropy munin graph by setting a minimum
          for the Y axis.  This corrects issues in the graph when
          the daemon restarts.

v1.1.1
	Fix bug where ekeyd would sit and spin if ekeydctl shutdown
	was used to stop the daemon.
	Improve logging and retry behaviour for ekeyd-egd-linux.
	Add a --device option to ekey-rekey and make it remove any
	spaces in the master key to make input more tolerant of
	users copying the spaces from the master key card.
	Update the state machine to better cope with unexpected
	buffering of the packet stream causing long-term-key-bad
	events where they were not correct.
	Lots of bits to support MirBSD thanks to Thorsten Glaser.
	Munin support updated and defaults altered to be of more
	use to normal people.

v1.1.0
	Improve the control over ekeyd-egd-linux connection retrying.
	Fix a memory leak in the EGD server implementation.
	Various exit-path cleanups, courtesy of Eric Sesterhenn.

v1.0.7
	Support the rekeying of Entropy Key devices whose serial
	numbers encode to contain a slash symbol.

v1.0.6
	Append entropy when writing to a file on disk.  Hold off on
	issuing rekey nonces a little to produce more reliable
	rekeying behaviour during high load scenarios.  Correct a
	bug in the ulusbd which caused "Vanished?" messages which
	were spurious as the devices were still connected.
v1.0.5
	Correct a logic hiccough in the no-pidfile path out of the
	daemonise function used by the daemons.  Add some syslog()
	to the ulusbd to better diagnose issues related to it.
v1.0.4
	Munin scripts, better handling of poll() related errors in
	main daemon to allow for debugging via strace.  Pointless
	writes in the EGD layer removed to reduce CPU consumption
	when no entropy is available but there are clients 
        requesting it.  An attempt at buildability on GNU/kFreeBSD.
v1.0.3
	Manual page updates, AUTHORS file, ekey-setkey now retries
	more effectively than before.
v1.0.2
	Additional copyright and authoring information along with
	clearer attribution for non-Simtec source in the software.
v1.0.1
	Corrected an issue related to multiple Entropy Key devices
	attached to the same ekeyd instance.
v1.0
	First public release of the Entropy Key software.
